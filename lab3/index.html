        <p class="para">👋 Hi there! I'm a B.Tech student specializing in Information Technology at Aditya Institute of Technology and Management, eager to dive into the professional world and start my career journey. 🌐
            My academic journey (2022-2026) has been a blend of learning and applying; whether it’s crafting efficient solutions with C++ and Python 🐍 or optimizing databases with MySQL. I have a keen interest in Data Structures and Algorithms, which has honed my problem-solving skills. 📊
            I am passionate about technology and order 🧑‍💻. Being systematic and responsible, I have always strived to keep my work organized and on point. This mindset ensures I approach problems with precision and deliver results efficiently.
            Languages are my tool of choice for bridging communication gaps. As a native Telugu speaker and fluent in English, I am comfortable navigating multicultural environments and collaborating effectively.
            💡 Eager to take on new challenges, I am looking forward to my first professional experience where I can apply my technical skills and contribute to meaningful projects. Currently, I am actively looking for roles that will help me grow and make a tangible impact.
